**Task 04: Traffic Accident Data Analysis**

📌 **Objective**
To analyze traffic accident data and visualize patterns related to accident severity, time of occurrence, weather conditions, and road infrastructure.

🛠 **Tools Used**

* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📊 **Description**
In this task, traffic accident data was explored to uncover trends associated with accident severity, time-based patterns, traffic signal presence, and weather conditions. Multiple visualizations were developed to extract meaningful insights and support data-driven road safety improvements.

📈 **Visualizations Created**

* Accident severity distribution bar chart
* Accidents by hour of day line plot
* Average severity at traffic signal locations bar chart
* Top weather conditions during accidents bar chart

🔍 **Key Observations**

* Accident severity varies across multiple levels, reflecting different impact intensities.
* Most accidents occur during peak traffic hours, indicating higher risk periods.
* Locations without traffic signals tend to show higher average accident severity.
* Clear and cloudy weather conditions account for most reported accidents.

🎯 **Learning Outcomes**

* Performing real-world data analysis using Pandas
* Creating multi-visualization plots with Matplotlib
* Identifying patterns related to time, weather, and infrastructure
* Enhancing interpretation of large-scale datasets
